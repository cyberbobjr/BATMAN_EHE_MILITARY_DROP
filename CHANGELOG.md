# Changelog

Each `## <version> — <date>` section is published as the Steam Workshop change note
(`.claude/tools/steam_workshop_publish.py`). The top version must match `modversion=` in `mod.info`.

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

- First Build 42.21 release: standalone rewrite of Expanded Helicopter Events: Drop Military Cargo (Build 41), multiplayer-safe.
- Military documents shown like the game's newspapers: a typed memorandum with handwritten notes, and the codebook as an open kraft folder with a clear code grid.
- Optional Signal Smoke integration: when that mod is active, green smoke marks the crate for 60 in-game minutes (sandbox option).
- Weekly authentication code (changes every Monday at 00:00, previous code accepted for 24 hours): encrypted by a numbers station on shortwave and deciphered with military codebooks found on army zombies and in army storage. Sandbox option: no code, fixed code or weekly code in clear on the notes. After 3 wrong codes in a day, the base stops answering the caller until the next day.
